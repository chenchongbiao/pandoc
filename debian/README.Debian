# Notes about Debian packaging of Pandoc

## Standalone output not always fully standalone

Some output formats depend on external material,
e.g. Javascript code for rendering mathematical equations.

Pandoc commonly links to such external material hosted on a public CDN.
Due to concerns for potential breach of privacy,
Debian-packaged Pandoc instead links to locally packaged material.
